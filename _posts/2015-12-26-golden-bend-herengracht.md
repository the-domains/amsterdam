_Golden Bend in the Herengracht, Gerrit Adriaensz. Berckheyde, 1671 - 1672_

> Due to the enormous increase of its population, Amsterdam had to expand 
> during the 17th century: the city's rings of canals were dug in phases.

Here we see the Herengracht under construction, with a few lots still 
empty. This particular section of the canal became the domain of the 
very richest. Some of the residents earned their money from trade in 
Asia, and almost every interior boasted Asian luxury goods.
